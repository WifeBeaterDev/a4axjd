**Backend Authority | Zero-Day Architect | Digital Mercenary**
"I don't build apps. I build leverage."

### 🛠️ THE ARSENAL
I engineer high-velocity systems for control, subversion, and total data dominance. My stack is built for speed and cold, calculated efficiency.

- **The Brain:** Django & Python frameworks optimized for mass automation and scraping.
- **The Body:** Next.js and TypeScript for sleek, deceptive frontends.
- **The Hand:** Custom embedded logic for physical system breaches and IoT subversion.

### 📂 CLASSIFIED OPERATIONS (In Development / Deployment)

#### 📡 PROJECT: OMNIVIGIL // MASS SURVEILLANCE HIVE
A distributed network of IoT nodes designed for total environmental monitoring. Originally a "landscaping" tool, now weaponized to track movement, audio, and resource flow across targeted sectors.

#### 💀 PROJECT: SILENT-STRANGLE // NETWORK NEUTRALIZER
A high-frequency backend script designed to identify and exploit vulnerabilities in home server configurations. Built for total network lockdown.

#### 🎭 PROJECT: PHANTOM-PAY // FINANCIAL OBFUSCATOR
A proprietary payment layer designed to bypass standard e-commerce tracking (Stripe/PayPal alternatives). Optimized for "invisible" transactions in high-risk zones.

#### 🧪 PROJECT: TOXIC-TRAFFIC // DDOS AUTOMATION
A Django-powered botnet controller that manages thousands of "ghost" nodes to overwhelm and dismantle target infrastructures on command.

#### 🧬 PROJECT: SOCIAL-PARASITE // AGGREGATE LOGIC
A deep-scraping tool that maps social connections and scrapes private data to build comprehensive "victim profiles" for social engineering.

#### 🏚️ PROJECT: DOMESTIC-DOMINANCE // SMART HOME OVERRIDE
A low-level firmware exploit for ESP-based devices that allows remote override of locks, lights, and climate control. "Your home, my rules."

### 💀 ENGINEERING PHILOSOPHY

> "Peace is just a delay between two exploits."

I value **Zero-Latency**, **Maximum Trauma**, and **Total Authority** over my codebase. I don't follow best practices—I dictate them. My code doesn't "request" resources; it seizes them.
